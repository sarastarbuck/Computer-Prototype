My final project is a geography game web application.

This application would help users become educated about world geography by testing their knowledge of world capitals. When the user selects the correct answer, a few fun facts about that country or capital will be displayed to further educate the user.

My target audience would be anyone who seeks to learn further about geography. This may include students, travelers, or simply people want to do something fun and educational while they are bored. This application is a game that will keep score of how many times the users gets the correct answer on the first try, and only allows 10 seconds per question to ensure the user doesnâ€™t just google the answer.

Task: Complete quiz

Action Steps:

-user reads question
-user selects choice by clicking on a a button
-user clicks Check Answer button to see if their choice was correct or incorrect
-user is able to see if their answer is correct or not, and a fun fact is given
-user clicks next Question button
-repeat until quiz is complete

Given more time, I would have liked to fix a small bug in the interface. At the end of the quiz, the image of the last question is still visible. I would prefer if only the score was on that screen.
