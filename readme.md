Shallow aspects of prototype:
- Need to include map pictures for each question
- 10sec Timer for each question
- answer checker after each question, with an explanation for each right answer.
- total questions right


The interface allows users to start quiz, and select answers.
- user clicks ">" to begin quiz
- user reads question
- user selects their guess
- (when user select their guess If incorrect, I want an explanation of the right answer to appear, else it will display CORRECT)
